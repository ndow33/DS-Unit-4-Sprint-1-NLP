# Data Science Unit 4 Sprint 1

## Natural Language Processing

After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: Yelp. As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.

The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.

### Challenge Objectives

Successfully complete these all these objectives to earn a 2. There are more details on each objective further down in the notebook.

* Part 1: Write a function to tokenize the yelp reviews
* Part 2: Create a vector representation of those tokens
* Part 3: Use your tokens in a classification model on yelp rating
* Part 4: Estimate & Interpret a topic model of the Yelp reviews
